# To Certain Critics

Then call me traitor if you must,<br> 
Shout reason and default!<br>
Say I betray a sacred trust<br> 
Aching beyond this vault.<br>
I'll bear your censure as your praise,<br>  
For never shall the clan<br>
Confine my singing to its ways<br>  
Beyond the ways of man.<br>
<br>
No racial option narrows grief,<br>  
Pain is not patriot,<br>
And sorrow plaits her dismal leaf<br>  
For all as lief as not.<br>
With blind sheep groping every hill,<br>  
Searching an oriflamme,<br>
How shall the shpherd heart then thrill<br>  
To only the darker lamb??<br>

Perfect<br>
